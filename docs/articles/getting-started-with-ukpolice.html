<p>This is still a little buggy at the moment as it returns blank columns for variables like <code>persistent_id</code> and <code>context</code>, <code>location_subtype</code>, and <code>outcome_status</code>. This issue is currently logged at <a href="https://github.com/njtierney/ukpolice/issues/11">issue #11</a>.</p>
